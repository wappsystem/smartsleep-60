                                    Please read this information carefully. Ask questions about anything that you don’t understand or want to know more about. Before deciding whether or not to take part, you might want to talk about it with a relative, friend or your local doctor.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Participation in this research is voluntary. If you don’t wish to take part, you don’t have to. You will receive the best possible care whether or not you take part.

                                    <br><br>
                                    The aim of this project is to assess the accuracy of an online assessment tool for identifying sleep problems when compared to a diagnosis given by a sleep specialist.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The aim of the Alertness Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) is to reduce the burden of impaired alertness on the safety, productivity and health of Australians. The broad CRC program aims to develop and deploy the next generation of shift scheduling and workplace design techniques; alertness assessment devices; individualised programs for better sleep health; and a range of innovative strategies to reduce fatigue. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    These new products and services have the potential to reduce direct and indirect health and economic costs of sleep disorders in the community.

                                    This research is being conducted by The Adelaide Institute for Sleep Health: A Flinders Research Centre of Excellence and Woolcock Institute of Medical Research (NSW).

                                    A member of the research team will contact you by phone and the consent process will occur completely outside of the medical care. For community consumers, the consent process will happen online and over the phone. You will be informed that your participation is entirely voluntary and that you can choose not to participate or to withdraw from the study at any time without affecting your medical care in any way and that no study assessments will be completed until the consent form has been signed.
                                    <br><br>
                                    It is desirable that your local doctor be advised of your decision to participate in this research project. If you have a local doctor, we strongly recommend that you inform them of your participation in this research project.

                                    the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research using online social media advertisements (e.g. Facebook). Both clinical patients and community volunteers will be recruited for this study.

                                    This study follows on from an initial study which used existing and newly developed sleep health questionnaires designed to evaluate the likelihood of potential common sleep problems including, snoring/sleep apnoea, insomnia, delayed sleep phase disorder, shift work and chronic sleep restriction.

                                    The aim of this project is to refine the risk assessment of common sleep problems as derived by the previous study when compared to sleep specialist assessment. You will follow the standard clinical procedures regarding consultation and treatment options for any sleep problem at your physician appointment.

                                    You do not have to take part in this research project to receive treatment at this hospital.  Other options are available; these include consultation with a sleep physician, sleep psychologist, or other relevant medical practitioner. Your study doctor will discuss these options with you before you decide whether or not the take part in this research project. You can also discuss the options with your local doctor.

                                    There is no immediate benefit to you. Volunteers will have the opportunity to contribute to important research to help development of better online tools to help with sleep problem screening that can lead to online self-help sleep therapies that are accessible to wider community ahead of clinical investigation.

                                    The decision tree algorithm tested in this project will provide feedback to you regarding their answers to the survey and their objective data. You will be followed up by a sleep specialist at which time they will consult with the clinician regarding the feedback and potential sleep problems, at which time they will be advised regarding pathways into normal clinical care when appropriate.

                                    Sometimes during the course of a research project, new information becomes available about the treatment that is being studied. If this happens, your study doctor will tell you about it and discuss with you whether you want to continue in the research project. If you decide to withdraw, your study doctor will make arrangements for your regular health care to continue. If you decide to continue in the research project you will be asked to sign an updated consent form.

                                    Also, on receiving new information, your study doctor might consider it to be in your best interests to withdraw you from the research project. If this happens, he/ she will explain the reasons and arrange for your regular health care to continue.

This notice will allow that person or the research supervisor to discuss any health risks or special requirements linked to withdrawing. If you do withdraw your consent during the research project, the study doctor and relevant study staff will not collect additional personal information from you, although personal information already collected will be retained to ensure that the results of the research project can be measured properly and to comply with law. You should be aware that data collected by the sponsor up to the time you withdraw will form part of the research project results.  If you do not want them to do this, you must tell them before you join the research project.
